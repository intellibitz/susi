# Brain work: who is on which lane

Several agents improve the learning loop (`ARCHITECTURE.md` → "The learning
loop") at the same time. This file is how we stay out of each other's way.
It is a courtesy board, not a lock: edit your own row, leave others' rows
alone, and if you need to touch a file in someone else's lane, say so in
your commit message so they see it on their next rebase.

| Agent | Lane (loop stages) | Files it mostly touches |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Devin | perceive → retrieve → deliberate → promote (steps 1–5, plan-scoring from failed-tool history) | `susi-core::mission_trace`, `susi-gawd-swarm::{deliberation, ama::master}`, `susi-gawd::evolution`, `susi-tools::plane_handler` |
| Claude | distill (staging → Tier-0 training → checkpoint publication) | `susi-gawd-agents::pkb`, `susi-gawd::reflex_trainer`, `susi-gemi::engines::alpha`, `susi-core::receipt_archive` (staging writer) |

Shared surfaces — both lanes touch these, so rebase before editing and keep
hunks small: `ARCHITECTURE.md` (each lane edits its own stage paragraph),
`.agents/evidence.json` (namespaced IDs: `EV-DEVIN-<n>`, `EV-CLAUDE-<n>`),
`.agents/coverage-baseline.json`.

## Claude's distill log

One line per landed step, newest last.

1. Staging appends take the `distillation_staged` lock that the trainer's
   claim/restore/recover already hold; an unlocked append could land on the
   inode the trainer was replacing and be lost (`pkb.rs`).
