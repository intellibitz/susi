# Step 1: Susi builds, tests, improves and uses itself

This is the CEO's first step of a 100-step vision. Finish and measure this
step before treating later capabilities as delivered. Agents own the entire
engineering loop; the CEO does not inspect code, configure the environment,
repair installations or perform technical approval. Standing Git commit,
push and merge authority does not waive evidence, credential, spending,
privacy or destructive-action boundaries.

Acceptance requires a real native Windows/MSVC build, an isolated local agent
change, serialized integration of the combined tree, debug and optimized
production artifacts, license/native-source checks, fresh-user operation,
first-goal inference, health verification and a demonstrated rollback. Each
receipt must identify source, dependency lock, toolchain, target, artifact
digest and actual commands/results. GitHub is optional. A fixture proving
the release machinery is not evidence that Susi itself is production-ready.

The production qualifier runs formatting, strict license checks, workspace
Clippy, workspace tests and an optimized native build against the immutable
locally integrated commit. Its packaged gate evidence includes measured CLI
health for version, help and status. Promotion and rollback recheck package
integrity and repeat these checks before changing the atomic current-release
reference. Existing running processes are not replaced or certified by this
reference update.

## Initial resource budgets

Zero bloat means justified capabilities and enforced measured budgets, not
literally zero storage or memory. The initial policy is an executable at most
256 MiB; each CLI health command at most 30 seconds, 2 GiB sampled foreground
resident memory and 2 MiB combined output. These conservative starting ceilings
are informed by the recorded approximately 91 MiB debug executable and 1 GiB
model-use process; they are not performance promises or optimized targets.
Actual values and limits are retained with pass/fail evidence. Changing a
budget requires a reviewed engineering rationale and fresh measurements.

Memory and output are sampled every 10 ms while the owned foreground process
exists. They are detection thresholds, not hard OS allocation limits: brief
spikes and bytes emitted between samples may exceed them. Descendant memory,
model-cache storage and whole-machine use are not included. A timeout or
budget violation kills and reaps the exact owned child and fails qualification.
The evidence must never call sampled RSS an OS peak working set.

## Remaining acceptance beyond CLI health

Version, help and status do not establish model inference, daemon service
health, an uncached installation or recovery of a running production service.
Production must additionally execute real first-goal prompts using the exact
candidate under isolated runtime state with inherited provider credentials
and endpoints removed. Model identity/license/digest and provisioning mode
(verified cache versus uncached download) must be explicit. Retain bounded
output, actual inference traces and resource measurements, and bind them to
the artifact receipt. An editable external success report is insufficient.

Until that integrated acceptance and all strict license gates pass, the
production qualification remains incomplete. Do not label Step 1 complete,
claim every mandate fulfilled, or promote a fixture as the product.
