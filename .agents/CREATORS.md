# SUSI Creator Interface Protocols

* **Current Engine Version**: `v0.1.2022884`

This document defines the three absolute fronts of interaction between Human Creators and the `susi` substrate. It maps the intention of the Creator to the exact epistemic boundary within the engine.

## 1. Motions (Alpha-Self Mutation)
1. **Definition**: Architectural evolution and structural engineering.
2. **Blast Radius**: The immutable `alpha-self` core (binary code, traits, genome).
3. **Sovereign Boundary**: Motions are **Creator-Only**. They require the SUSI Genome Source (`src/`) and a Rust compiler.
4. **Protocol (`MOTIONS.md`)**: A Motion is an authorized Creator directive that exposes a capability gap or defines a new aspiration. It triggers the `Motion Rule` (Test-Driven Evolution). The engine will autonomously synthesize, compile, and deploy new Rust logic to heal the gap.
5. **Command Syntax**: `susi "<motion_intent>"` (or `susi pulse "<motion_intent>"`)

## 2. Missions (Alpha-World Evolution)
6. **Definition**: Dynamic task fulfillment and workspace state generation.
7. **Blast Radius**: The mutable `alpha-world` environment and the active workspace (`.susi/`, local files).
8. **Protocol (`MISSIONS.md`)**: A Mission is an explosive swarm execution. The engine recruits specialists, converges on a Chain of Truth via the Mission Blackboard, generates artifacts, and ultimately stages the experience for Substrate Ingestion (training the Native Tier 2 model).
9. **Command Syntax**: `susi "<mission_intent>"` (or `susi pulse "<mission_intent>"`)

## 3. Queries (Zero-Mutation)
10. **Definition**: Ephemeral substrate interrogation and stateless analytics.
11. **Blast Radius**: None. Strictly Read-Only.
12. **Protocol (`QUERIES.md`)**: A Query bypasses the evolutionary pipeline and the mission blackboard. It executes directly via the native engine (Alpha, Vision, Audio) or administrative layer, returning a semantic response to `stdout` without leaving a permanent artifact.
13. **Command Syntax**: `susi "<query_intent>"` (or `susi pulse "<query_intent>")`)
